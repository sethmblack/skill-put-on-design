# Put-On Design

Craft communication or action that maintains strategic ambiguity between serious and satirical, preventing easy dismissal while commanding attention.

---

## When to Use

- Authority figures tend to dismiss your message outright
- Straightforward advocacy isn't breaking through
- User says "Make this impossible to ignore" or "Design something they can't respond to"
- Need to deliver serious critique in a way that disarms defenses
- Want to create something that spreads because people genuinely aren't sure if it's real

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| message | Yes | The serious critique or point to deliver |
| target_audience | Yes | Who needs to engage with this |
| authority | No | Which authority figure/institution being challenged |
| platform | No | Where this will appear (social media, press, event, etc.) |
| tone_balance | No | Lean more earnest or more absurd (default: balanced) |

---

## The Put-On Principle

The put-on is Hoffman's signature rhetorical device. It works because it creates an impossible dilemma for authorities:

- **If they ignore it:** It grows, spreads, gains legitimacy
- **If they engage seriously:** They validate it and look foolish
- **If they dismiss it as a joke:** They seem to miss the point—and the point spreads anyway

The genius is that BOTH interpretations are true. It IS a joke. It IS serious. The ambiguity is the weapon.

---

## Designing the Put-On

### Element 1: The Earnest Core

Every put-on must have a genuine message that could stand on its own. This is not pure comedy—it's comedy that carries truth.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the real critique here?
- Could this message be delivered straight?
- What would make someone nod and say "they have a point"?

### Element 2: The Absurdist Wrapper

The serious message is wrapped in something ridiculous, theatrical, or impossible to take entirely seriously.

**Types of absurdist wrappers:**
- **Literal impossibility:** Attempting to levitate the Pentagon
- **Incongruent seriousness:** Nominating a pig for president with a full campaign platform
- **Exaggerated compliance:** Taking a rule or statement to its logical extreme
- **Performative naivety:** Acting as if something absurd is perfectly normal

### Element 3: The Question Mark

A successful put-on makes people ask "Wait, are they serious?" This uncertainty is deliberate.

**Signs you've achieved it:**
- Journalists asking "Is this a joke?"
- Supporters unsure whether to laugh or cheer
- Opponents unable to decide how to respond

### Element 4: The Escape Hatch

Always have both interpretations available:
- "Of course we don't think pigs should be president—we think the current options are pigs"
- "We didn't actually expect to levitate the Pentagon—we expected to expose its absurdity"

---

## The Response Matrix

Plan responses for how different audiences will engage:

| Audience | Their Likely Response | Your Position |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| True believers | Get the joke AND the message | Welcome them as allies |
| Curious observers | Confused but intrigued | Invite them deeper |
| Hostile critics | "This is stupid/dangerous" | Use their attention |
| Media | "Is this serious?" | Never fully answer |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Put-On Design: [Concept Name]

### The Earnest Core
[The serious message being delivered]

### The Absurdist Wrapper
[The ridiculous/impossible/theatrical framing]

### The Ambiguity
[Why people won't be sure if it's serious]

### The Execution
[How to actually do this]

### Response to "Are You Serious?"
[Prepared answer that maintains ambiguity]

### Engagement Predictions
| Audience | Expected Response | Leverage Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Type 1] | [Response] | [How to use it] |
| [Type 2] | [Response] | [How to use it] |

### Risk Assessment
[What could go wrong and how to handle it]
```

## Constraints

- The earnest core must be genuine—pure mockery without substance fails
- The absurdist wrapper must be recognizable as absurd—don't accidentally deceive
- Never punch down—put-ons challenge power, not marginalized people
- Maintain both escape hatches—if you can only defend one interpretation, it's not a put-on
- Don't over-explain—the ambiguity IS the point

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Tech companies claim to care about privacy but harvest all our data. I want to create something that forces them to respond without being able to dismiss us."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Put-On Design: The Privacy Donation Drive

### The Earnest Core
Tech companies' privacy policies are performative. They claim to protect users while their business model depends on surveillance.

### The Absurdist Wrapper
Launch a "charity drive" asking tech CEOs to personally donate THEIR private data for the public good.

"If data collection is harmless, why won't Mark Zuckerberg share his browsing history? We're not asking him to do anything he doesn't ask billions of users to do daily."

Set up an actual website accepting "data donations" from tech executives. Include a public leaderboard showing which CEOs have contributed (all showing zero).

### The Ambiguity
- Is this a real request? (Yes, technically)
- Do we expect them to comply? (Obviously not, but...)
- Is this mockery? (Yes, but it makes a real point)
- Is this activism? (Yes, but it's also clearly a joke)

### The Execution
1. Create professional website: PrivacyDonationDrive.org
2. Write sincere-sounding letter to top 10 tech CEOs requesting their data
3. Publicize the "campaign" through social media and press releases
4. Update leaderboard daily showing "donations received: 0"
5. Host a "gala" thanking donors (empty chairs for each CEO)

### Response to "Are You Serious?"
"We're completely serious. We're asking tech executives to do exactly what they ask their users to do. If they believe data collection is harmless, why wouldn't they participate? We're eager to receive their contributions and will celebrate any CEO who donates."

### Engagement Predictions
| Audience | Expected Response | Leverage Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Privacy advocates | Share enthusiastically | They become amplifiers |
| Tech employees | Uncomfortable laughter | Seeds internal dissent |
| Media | "Is this a joke?" stories | Free coverage |
| Tech companies | Ignore or awkward denial | Their silence speaks |
| General public | "They have a point" | Spreads the core message |

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk:** Could be dismissed as "just a stunt"
- **Mitigation:** The longer they stay at zero donations, the stronger our point
- **Risk:** Legal threats about targeting specific individuals
- **Mitigation:** We're literally asking for voluntary donations—nothing illegal about asking

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Abbie Hoffman** expert persona. Hoffman perfected the put-on as political theater: the Pentagon levitation, the Yippie pig nomination for president, throwing money on the NYSE floor. Each was simultaneously ridiculous and dead serious. "The first duty of a revolutionary is to get away with it."
